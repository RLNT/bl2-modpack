## **üìë Overview**
We were bored of many modpacks and wanted to implement our own touch which fits our playstyle.

So we decided to create an own modpack. Since we are using it only for personal use, it's lacking a lot of required credits and therefor it won't be published anywhere. GitHub is just used so we don't lose the files again.

It's a mixture of PythonSDK and text mods but everything is automatically loaded.

In case you want to try it out yourself although we don't really explain what exactly it changes in the game, feel free to download and use it.


## **üîß Installation**

1. download the repository as zip
2. extract the files and run the BL2Fix installer from the installation directory
   - this will install all dependencies as well such as the PythonSDK
   - the other files in the installation directory are needed for the installation process but might be outdated
   - you can redownload the files from the original locations if they are outdated, the installer will tell you everything you need to know
3. go to the files directory from the downloaded zip and extract those files into your Borderlands 2 Binaries folder
   - replace everything if you are asked to
   - the folder structure already matches the correct path so it's just drag and drop
4. now open the BLCMM.exe which is located in your Binaries folder and patch Borderlands 2
5. open the game, open the Mod Menu and activate all mods which are marked as favorite
6. join the game and play
   - you can see if the modpack works if you have a MODS option and a message showing up in the main menu
   - also in-game, there should be a yellow message underneath the badass menu
   - there are no console commands required and everything is automatically loaded


## **‚è∞ Changelog**
Everything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].


## **üéì License**
We do not own or take credit of any mods in this modpack.
As we said, there are a lot of credits missing.

All rights go to the respective mod authors!
